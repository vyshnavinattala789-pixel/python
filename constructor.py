Constructor is a special method used to create and initialize an object of a class.
Destructor is used to destroy the object.

Using self, we can access the instance variable and instance method of the object.
class Student:

     def __init__(self,name):
           self.name=name

     def show(self):
         print('Hello,my nameis',self.name)
s1 = Student('Yashi')
s1.show()class Student:
